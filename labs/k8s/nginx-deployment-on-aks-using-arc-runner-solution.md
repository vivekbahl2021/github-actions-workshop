## Solution: NGINX Deployment on AKS Using ARC Runner

```yaml
name: K8s ARC Runner NGINX

on:
  push:
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/k8s-arc-runner-nginx.yml'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run:
    runs-on: arc-runner-set
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code to get any necessary configuration files
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4.1.7

      # Step 2: Set up kubectl
      - name: Set up kubectl
        uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
        with:
          kubectl-version: 'v1.25.0'

      # Step 3: Configure kubectl to connect to AKS
      - name: Configure kubectl
        uses: azure/aks-set-context@v1
        with:
          resource-group: 'arc-lab-rg'
          cluster-name: 'arc-lab-cluster'
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL }}

      # Step 4: Deploy an existing Docker image (e.g., nginx) to AKS
      - name: Deploy NGINX to AKS
        run: |
          kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment --image=nginx:latest
          kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
          kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment

      # Step 5: Verify that the deployment was successful by checking the pods and service
      - name: Verify Deployment
        run: |
          kubectl get pods
          kubectl get services
          kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment

      # Optional: Clean up the deployment after the demo
      # - name: Clean up deployment
      #   run: |
      #     kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
      #     kubectl delete service nginx-deployment
```
