# Custom Workflow

## Introduction

In this lab you will customize the existing workflow to trigger when a change is made to the `src` folder on the main branch. You will also add steps to the workflow to use an action that greets Mona the Octocat.

> Duration: 10-15 minutes

## Update the workflow to trigger when a change is made to the `src` folder on main branch

1. Open the workflow file [custom-workflow.yml](/.github/workflows/custom-workflow.yml)
2. Edit the file and copy the following YAML content after line 4:

```YAML
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'src/**'

```

3. Commit the workflow changes into the `main` branch
4. Change a file inside the folder [src](/src)
5. Commit the changes into the `main` branch
6. Go to `Actions` and see the details of your running workflow

## Add steps to your workflow

1. Open the workflow file [custom-workflow.yml](/.github/workflows/custom-workflow.yml)
2. Edit the file and copy the following YAML content at the end of the file:

```YAML
  # This step uses GitHub's hello-world-javascript-action: https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action
- name: Hello world
  uses: actions/hello-world-javascript-action@main
  with:
    who-to-greet: "Mona the Octocat"
  id: hello
# This step prints an output (time) from the previous step's action.
- name: Echo the greeting's time
  run: echo 'The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}.'

```

3. Optional remove the `paths` to trigger the workflow on any push to main branch
4. Commit the changes into the `main` branch
5. If not step 3), change a file inside the folder [src](/src) and commit the changes into the `main` branch
6. Go to `Actions` and see the details of your running workflow

```YAML
name: Custom Workflow
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'src/**'
jobs:
  execute:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - run: echo "🎉 The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "🐧 This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "🔎 The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."

      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - run: echo "💡 The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "🖥️ The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."

      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}

      - run: echo "🍏 This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."

      - name: Adding Markdown
        run: echo "### Hello world! :rocket:" >> "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"

        # This step uses GitHub's hello-world-javascript-action: https://github.com/actions/hello-world-javascript-action
      - name: Hello World
        uses: actions/hello-world-javascript-action@main
        with:
          who-to-greet: 'Mona the Octocat'
        id: hello

        # This step prints an output (time) from the previous step's action.
      - name: Echo the greeting's time
        run: echo 'The time was ${{ steps.hello.outputs.time }}.'
